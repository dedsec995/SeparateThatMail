# SeparateThatMail

This repo contains code for generating dataset, cleaning and fine tuning uncased BERT model.

This system uses a fine-tuned BERT model to automatically classify job-related emails into `applied`, `reject`, or `accept` categories, helping me organize my inbox

### Isn't BERT an overkill?

Well Yes and No, Yes I could have used `spaCy` or some other package with simple naive bayes classifier instead of encoder only transformer model infact most of the mail providers like gmail use it, but hey I wanted AI like everyone else and I can so I did :P. Also I have very less error rate with very little efforts, so Why NOT!!! 

### How do I use it?

Hey you have to know / atleast understand the code. It's the most basic ones in NLP applications, if you really need instructions, maybe it's time to introspect and ask question to ~life~ a heavily quantized piece of code trained on lossy approximation :)
